<p>This page demonstrates the difference between root scope and a scope. A root scope is a scope created on the HTML elements that contains the ng-app directive. A root scope is available in the entire application.</p>

<p>In this page, a variable color exist both in the root scope and controller's scope. This application display color which exist in the current scope. </p>
<p>The rootScope's favorite color:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

<div ng-controller="myCtrl">

<p>The scope of the controller's favorite color:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

</div>

<p>The rootScope's favorite color is still:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

<script>
	var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
	app.run(function($rootScope) {
	    $rootScope.color = 'blue';
	});
	app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
	    $scope.color = "red";
	});
</script>

<p>Notice that controller's color variable does not overwrite the rootScope's color value.</p>
